                Command-line interfaces (CLIs) are still used today in situations which require precision and control. 
                CLIâ€™s today are mainly used by IT administrators and other power users as their work requires precise control, 
                efficiency and speed. For example, if a user had to erase 1000 files within a folder the command line would make 
                it possible to perform this task by typing in a single command. Yet with GUI this task would seem tedious as the 
                user would have to navigate to the folder, highlight the files and delete them. Presently, graphical user interfaces 
                are more popular in comparison to the CLI. They are utilized everywhere, especially with PCs. The simplicity due to 
                the visual graphics makes it easy for users with no computer knowledge to work the GUI. Unlike the CLI, GUI does 
                not require the memorization of commands, thus making it more understandable and easy to use. GUIs are commonly 
                used by users who require multitasking, a feature which most CLIs lack. For example, GUIs are useful when a student 
                it writing a project and need to run multiple programs, such as an internet browser, word processor and photo editor.
