			<p class="answer">
				The vision of Microsoft is to make an utopia, a world where technology can be used in any situation. 
				For example, a person can analyze a specimen underwater instantly, rather than having them taken into a lab. 
				There is advanced technology that they can do expected job right away. Microsoft’s vision is to make holograms, 
				thin paper line tablets, efficient underwater equipments, glasses that could translate any language and finally, 
				to make walls that can act like a computer. Thus, Microsoft’s ultimate vision is to manufacture technology that 
				was once confined to science fiction.

				friendly manufacturing process, safe working conditions and employees assurance, Apple intends to produce

					Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional 
					software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented 
					the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App store, and is defining the future of mobile media and 
					computing devices with iPad

			<p class="answer">
				As shown above we can see that both companies share a common interest in producing the best of their products 
				for the customers and also to produce products that are environmentally sound. Yet, Apple’s vision is similar 
				to that of any other company’s vision. It is to give the customer their products with full capabilities. However, 
				Microsoft's vision is different. It intends to make a utopia, to make science fiction technology a reality. 
				Microsoft strives to go above and beyond the computer, implementing technology into the world around us.
