                Bill Gates uses a democratic leadership style in decision-making. His positive attitude encouraged 
                the members of his team to work to the fullest. Though he listens to advice from his team, he is not 
                very good at sharing his own ideas and thoughts as the computer genius of the team. His brilliant 
                ideas could have brought Microsoft to the top of the computer companies sooner if he learned how to 
                express his mind. Steve Jobs uses a different, rather an authoritarian leadership style in 
                decision-making and running his company. Though his ideas are brilliant and mainly presented in all 
                Apple products, he does not understand the benefit of his team. This way of leading made work 
                inefficient and tiring for both him and his team members which often resulted in a negative atmosphere 
                in the Apple workspace. Despite his centralized authority, Steve Jobs is considered to be one of the 
                biggest risk takers in the world. His high risk taking, innovative, and creativity is what had driven 
                Apple to success.
