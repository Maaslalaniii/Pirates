			Bill Gates uses a democratic leadership style in decision-making. His positive attitudes encouraged the members of his team to work to the fullest. Though he listens to advice from his team, he is not very good at sharing his own ideas and thoughts as the computer genius of the team. His brilliant ideas could have brought Microsoft to the top of the computer companies sooner if he learned how to express his mind. Steve Jobs uses a different, rather an authoritarian leadership style in decision-making and running his company. Though his ideas are brilliant and mainly presented in all Apple products, but unlike Bill he does not understand the benefit of his team, making work inefficient and tiring which often resulted in negative impressions upon the authoritarian leader.
