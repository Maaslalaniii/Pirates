                Both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs managed to achieve their own computer companies. Their rivalry made them the 
                world's richest people. Their innovation of the computer has further developed human capabilities and efficiency. 
                For example, for the first time people were able to write without papers. Also, the invention of the computer 
                brought the Internet,  a worldwide system of computers by giving the capability of having relationship with people 
                within and outside the countries. It created a world where children could play games inside their homes rather than 
                wandering somewhere unsafe. Although we gained many advantages through their rivalry, we also had many 
                disadvantages too. For example, the invention of the computer games has distracted people from reality. 
                It also has made people distant from their families and friends even though they are connected through the 
                internet.  Also, the cyberbullying has come into play a significant role in our life.
