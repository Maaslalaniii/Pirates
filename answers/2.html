            The technologies discussed in the film may seem to bring nothing but success and innovation, yet in reality many 
            consequences resulted from these inventions. With the success of the Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh PCs became 
            a common part of everyday households. Although this may seen to be an advantage, reality is that the computers 
            would soon start to consume more time in a person’s life. With the ease of use provided by the Macintosh, many 
            people started to spend more time on computers, instead of spending time with family and loved ones. The affects 
            consequence is still relevant today, as many people prefer spending time behind a screen instead of physically 
            communicating with one another.

            be an economic consequence for the companies producing computers, as sales were much more difficult to achieve. 
            This was especially true for The Lisa, whose failure was ultimately caused by its high price tag. Another issue 
            caused by the developing technology was the competition. Both Apple and Microsoft were huge competitors in the 
            race to build the best PC, which resulted in multiple conflicts, one being the moment when Jobs discovered Gates 
            had “stolen” his software to create Microsoft
