                If Bill Gates had failed, then the Windows systems that are widely used in today’s life would never 
                have existed, IBM wouldn’t have not won the competition against Apple, and OS would’ve have never 
                developed to what they are today. As we know, computers without operating systems are pretty useless, 
                thus computers would have never reached the popularity it has today. Apple would’ve became the most 
                famous computer seller, if Bill Gates had been unsuccessful.

                If Steve Jobs had failed at the beginning, then the Apple I would’ve never been created, thus 
                computers would’ve never been manufactured for the general public. Without Jobs’s success the GUI may 
                have never been utilized on computers which means we would still be using the command line with no 
                mouse in the 21st century. Without Jobs’s success with Apple, the biggest computer sellers would be 
                IBM and Microsoft.
