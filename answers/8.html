            The film proves to show that your intellectual property can never be completely secure. As displayed at various 
            points in the film, your ideas, creations and innovations can easily be stolen and altered. Such as the moment 
            where Bill Gates had revealed Windows, which was initially the software of the Macintosh, altered to fit 
            Microsoft's vision. Gates had swindled Jobs into believe that he was working for Apple, yet he was actually 
            using the guise in order to steal the Macintosh’s software. Upon confrontation from Jobs, Gates replied:
            <br>
            You and I are both like guys who had this rich neighbor - Xerox - who left the door open all the time. And you 
            go sneakin' in to steal a TV set. Only when you get there, you realize that I got there first. I got the loot, 
            Steve! And you're yellin'? That's not fair. I wanted to try to steal it first. You're too late.
            <br>
            This sole line encompassed the film’s view on intellectual property, addressing the fact that not one of your 
            innovations and hard work are safe from the threat of theft.
