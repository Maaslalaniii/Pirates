                    The film "Pirates of the Silicon Valley" discusses various world changing technologies such as…
                    The Apple I,
                    The Apple II,
                    The Lisa,

                <p class="question-body">
                    The technologies discussed in the film may seem to bring nothing but success and innovation, 
                    yet in reality many consequences resulted from these inventions. With the success of the Apple I, 
                    Apple II, and Macintosh PCs became a common part of everyday households. Although this may seen to 
                    be an advantage, reality is that the computers would soon start to consume more time in a person’s life.

                <p class="question-body">
                    The technologies that are widely used in today’s daily life are Macs and Windows OS. Most of the 
                    users today have difficulties in deciding whether to buy the apple computers with their operating 
                    system built-in, or a normal computer and buy a operating system to install.

                <p class="question-body">
                    Bill Gates uses a democratic leadership style in decision-making. His positive attitudes encouraged 
                    the members of his team to work to the fullest. Though he listens to advice from his team, he is not 
                    very good at sharing his own ideas and thoughts as the computer genius of the team.

                    If Bill Gates had failed, then the Windows systems that are widely used in today’s life would never

                    developed to what they are today. As we know, computers without operating systems are pretty useless, 
                    thus computers would have never reached the popularity it has today.

                    Command-line interface is a user interface between the computer operation system and the user. 
                    When each command is prompt onto a specific line, information is given back by the system. 
                    An example of CIL would be MS-DOS in windows operating systems.

                <p class="question-body">
                    The film proves to show that your intellectual property can never be completely secure. 
                    As displayed at various points in the film, your ideas, creations and innovations can easily 
                    be stolen and altered. Such as the moment where Bill Gates had revealed Windows, which was 
                    initially the software of the Macintosh, altered to fit Microsoft's vision.
