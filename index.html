                4. Compare and contrast the leadership styles of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
            </h3>
            <p class="question-body">
                Bill Gates uses a democratic leadership style in decision-making. His positive attitudes encouraged 
                the members of his team to work to the fullest. Though he listens to advice from his team, he is not 
                very good at sharing his own ideas and thoughts as the computer genius of the team.

                With the girl in bright cloth representing Apple and the Big Brother representing IBM, Apple’s

            </h3>
            <p class="question-body">
                Command-line interface is a user interface between the computer operation system and the user. 
                When each command is prompt onto a specific line, information is given back by the system. 
                An example of CIL would be MS-DOS in windows operating systems.

                12.What does the film have to say about intellectual property?
            </h3>
            <p class="question-body">
                The film proves to show that your intellectual property can never be completely secure. 
                As displayed at various points in the film, your ideas, creations and innovations can easily 
                be stolen and altered. Such as the moment where Bill Gates had revealed Windows, which was 
                initially the software of the Macintosh, altered to fit Microsoft's vision.
